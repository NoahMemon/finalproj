#I plan to collaborate with Thakib Arowonowon 
#Thinking of modding a game or using one of the given ideas from Canvas, maybe the Notes app for iOS idea from CS50x. 
#No questions come to mind so far. 

#A notetaking app that you can collaborate with other people to take notes together. 

#Our software will allow for comments, highlighting, and collaborative simultaneous notetaking. 
It will be able to run on iOS and the user will run shared notes between users. 

It will not combine 1051's final project with another final project. Our project will have aspects such 
as loops, lists, and if statements. 

I will be working with Thakib Arowonowon, tup46790@temple.edu, and his TA's name is Zhengkang Fan

A good outcome will be that our app will be able to be run on iOS. 

A better outcome will be that our notetaking app will take notes simply

And a best outcome will be that our notetaking app will run on iOS and take notes as well as collaborative notetaking. 

We will need to figure out how to run an app on iOS and what that will look like. What files to import as well
as modules. Thakib and I are roommates so we be able to discuss what needs to get done each time we code.
